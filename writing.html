<h3>Wake Forest Excels in Annual NCAA GSR Report</h3>
<a href="http://www.wakeforestsports.com/genrel/110917aaa.html">Published</a> on the Wake Forest Athletics website on November 9, 2017.

<i>Wake Forest student-athletes ranked well above the national average in the 2017 NCAA Graduation Success Rate (GSR) report</i><BR><BR>
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. – Wake Forest student-athletes registered a graduation rate of 94 percent, according to the annual Graduation Success Rate (GSR) report released by the NCAA on Wednesday (Nov. 8). <BR><BR>
The figure stands seven percentage points ahead of the national average of 87 percent. Last year, Wake Forest registered a 92 percent graduation rate, which was eight percentage points ahead of the national average of 84. <BR><BR>
Seven Demon Deacon programs had a 100 percent graduation rate in this year’s release, which included student-athletes from 2007-2010. The seven teams that hit the century mark eclipses last year’s total of six. With the latest report, men’s soccer, men’s tennis, women’s basketball, field hockey, women’s golf, women’s tennis and women’s volleyball all hit the 100 percent mark. <BR><BR>
Since the GSR was first reported in 2004-05, women’s basketball, women’s volleyball, women’s tennis, women’s golf and men’s tennis have posted 100 percent in every release of the rate. <BR><BR>
Men’s soccer is the additional program to hit the 100 mark, improving from 86 percent in last year’s report. <BR><BR>
With cross country and track & field combined as one program, 11 of Wake Forest’s 14 programs checked in above the national average while five programs saw an increase in their graduation rate, led by men’s soccer with a 14 percent increase. Baseball, men’s basketball and men’s golf also improved their rates from last year. <BR><BR>
Football, which checked in at 93 percent, is one of only three football programs in the ACC to score a 90 or better each year, with Duke (96) and Boston College (90). The ACC remains the only conference to have multiple teams score a 90 or higher every year since 2005. 
Wake Forest’s 94 percent GSR is good for fourth in the Atlantic Coast Conference behind Notre Dame (98 percent), Duke (97 percent) and Boston College (95 percent). <BR><BR>
The NCAA also released the Federal Graduation Rates (FGR) with the report. Wake Forest checked in at 78 percent, which is 10 percent higher than the national average of 68 percent. The Demon Deacon mark checks in fifth in the ACC, behind Notre Dame (93 percent), Duke (86 percent) and Boston College and Virginia (80 percent). <BR><BR>
Both the GSR and FGR are based upon classes from 2007-10 and show the percentage of student-athletes earning a degree within six years. Unlike the FGR, the GSR includes incoming transfer students as well as students enrolling in the spring semester who receive athletic aid and graduate. <BR><BR>
The NCAA introduced the GSR in 2005 to accurately assess the academic success of student-athletes. The GSR formula removes from the rate student-athletes who leave school while academically eligible and includes student-athletes who transfer to a school after initially enrolling elsewhere. This calculation makes it a more complete and accurate look at student-athlete success.<BR><BR>

<h3>Feature Story: Austin Arians</h3>
 <a href="https://issuu.com/wakeforestdeaconclub/docs/04_wf_gold_rush_1-17_web">Published</a> in the January 2017 edition of Gold Rush, a publication by IMG College in conjunction with Wake Forest Athletics.<BR><BR>
     <i>Basketball is more than a sport for forward Austin Arians.  It’s family.</i><BR><BR>
Austin Arians can’t remember the last time he was without a basketball.<BR><BR>
“I’ve played for as long as I can remember,” said Arians with a quiet chuckle. “I’ve had a basketball in my hands since I began walking.”<BR><BR>
He’s sitting in his practice jersey outside of the Miller Center waiting excitedly for another Wake Forest men’s basketball afternoon practice to start. Just another day in the life. <BR><BR>
Basketball has been everything for the 23-year-old: his escape, his fun and, well, his family.<BR><BR>
His mother, Jen Arians, played basketball at Wyoming and Loyola Chicago while his father, Andy Arians, played at St. Norbert College and Wisconsin. His brother, Alex, will play at South Dakota State next season. <BR><BR>
“Playing basketball was never expected but I’ve been doing it for as long as I can remember,” said Arians. “I can’t imagine life without it.”<BR><BR>
Arians attended Madison Edgewood High School in Madison, Wisconsin. There, he averaged 17.2 points per game as a senior on his way to gathering Wisconsin Basketball Coaches Association Division 2 All-State and Associated Press Honorable Mention All-Divisions All-State honors. <BR><BR>
Arians was recruited out of high school to play at Milwaukee. Being close to home was a major benefit for the forward, since his family could come watch him play. However, it was then-head coach Rob Jeter and the team that determined Arians’ decision: Milwaukee felt like family.<BR><BR>
“There was a family atmosphere that I really wanted in a school,” said Arians. “Family is important to me. It’s important to have people you can trust, especially in your coaches and teammates. I felt that at Milwaukee.”<BR><BR>
Arians immediately made friends with his new teammates but there was one player that glued the squad together. Demetrius Harris was a senior when Arians arrived as a freshman leading to an estranged relationship due to the age gap. However, Harris had a way of making the team feel like family. He brought the Milwaukee team even closer when he was picked up as a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs.<BR><BR>
“You get close to guys like that,” said Arians of Harris. “Seeing him at the NFL combine and getting workouts with teams was really cool. It was really inspiring to us that he reached his goal.”<BR><BR>
While Arians may not have a NFL career ahead of him, an idea he quickly waived off, he’s working on one in basketball.<BR><BR>
Arians appeared in 64 games for the Panthers, starting in 36 of those, over two seasons. He totaled 577 points and a .435 field goal percentage while scoring double-digits in 28 games. He led the team with 17 points against Villanova in the NCAA Tournament in the 2013-14 season. He had a promising career ahead of him, until a preseason, season-ending ankle injury forced him to redshirt the 2014-15 season and put that career on hold.<BR><BR>
“It’s always tough to be injured. When things aren’t going great on the court, you want to be out there helping and when things go well, you want to be out there to enjoy that,” said Arians.<BR><BR>
But overall, being injured may have been a blessing in disguise. Arians became a part of the scout team and an extra set of eyes on the bench.<BR><BR>
“It was nice to sit back at a coach’s perspective and just learn even more about the game and the team,” he continued.<BR><BR>
Arians spent the season improving his play and the team’s performance without stepping on to the court for a single minute. When he was finally cleared to play, he picked up right where he left off. He started all 33 games for the Panthers during the 2015-16 season where he averaged 11.4 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. His teammates were with him every step of the way. <BR><BR>
“My family helped me through the injury but the most support came from my teammates,” said Arians. “They really pushed me and I continued to get better. I wanted to play with them. I wanted to be with them.” <BR><BR>
However, he would not finish out his eligibility with the Panthers. After coach Jeter was fired, Arians asked for his release. Within a day, he heard from Wake Forest head coach Danny Manning and associate head coach Randolph Childress.<BR><BR>
 “When you see that someone has graduated from a university with a degree, you assume he will bring a certain amount of maturity to a young team,” said head coach Danny Manning about his initial interest in Arians. “He had success in college and understood what college is about. Sure, I looked at his field goal percentage and things he is capable of doing out on the court but overall I think he has been a great fit for us.”<BR><BR>
Arians came on one visit before he committed to Wake Forest.<BR><BR>
“When I got here, I felt that same family atmosphere that I did at Milwaukee. That was really important to me. Family atmosphere is obviously a huge draw to me,” said Arians. <BR><BR>
But Arians’ decision to transfer to Wake Forest wasn’t based on his thoughts alone. It was a family affair.<BR><BR>
“I came with my parents and siblings and they all said to come here,” he said with a laugh. “They told me I had no choice, I had to come here.”<BR><BR>
That safe, encouraging environment that mimics an actual family is exactly what Wake Forest basketball strives to be.<BR><BR>
“We like to feel comfortable with our guys and spend time with them,” said Manning. “In the recruiting world, people say this and people say that and you don’t know what will happen until you get there and experience it. For us, as a staff and program, we do try to foster that type environment all the time.”<BR><BR>
 “Well, except when we’re on the practice court,” Manning continued, jokingly. “When they step on the court, we don’t want the nice, young men we recruited. We want assassins. Only on the court though.”<BR><BR>
Arians has found his success so far in wearing number 34 for the Demon Deacons. He has started in every game while holding a .500 field goal percentage and averaging 8.7 points per game. <BR><BR>
Arians finds his home away from home within his coaches and teammates. The team can often be found doing just about everything together. Most of the time, that means eating.<BR><BR>
“We all really like steak,” joked Arians.<BR><BR>
Arians is excited for what the 2016-17 season holds for Wake Forest basketball. As for looking ahead, he has one pretty simple goal. 
“I want to play basketball for as long as possible. Whoever takes me, it doesn’t matter. I just want to keep playing basketball and keep doing what I love,” said Arians.<BR><BR>
And his family, teammates, coaches and more, will be with him every step of the way. <BR><BR>

      <i>The Demon Deacons survived 2-1 in penalty kicks behind a heroic performance from Nonie Frishette</i><BR><BR>
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. - After playing to a scoreless draw through regulation and a pair of 10-minute overtime periods, No. 24 Wake Forest women's soccer advanced past No. 15 Georgetown on penalty kicks, 2-1, Friday night at Spry Stadium to move on to the second round of the NCAA Championship. <BR><BR>
The Demon Deacons are advancing to the second round of the NCAA Championship for the 12th time in program history and the first time since their last tournament appearance in 2013, when they fell to Virginia.<BR><BR>
Wake Forest (11-5-4) and Georgetown (14-3-4) played through 110 minutes without conceding a goal in a strong defensive battle, leading up to the penalty kicks. <BR><BR>
Georgetown started off PKs and Nonie Frishette, who came in off the bench and stepped into goal for penalty kicks, made the diving save. Maddie Huster went first for the Demon Deacons and easily found the back of the net to give the Deacs a 1-0 advantage. <BR><BR>
The Hoyas made their second PK attempt while the Deacs missed theirs, tying the score 1-all. <BR><BR>
Georgetown then hit the crossbar on the third attempt and Frishette made back-to-back stops while Bayley Feist hit her shot on the Deacon's fourth attempt to secure the 2-1 win in the shootout. <BR><BR>
Leading up to the PKs, the defense was stifling for both teams. The teams combined for four shots in the first half, with both of Wake Forest's attempts coming from Feist. The Hoyas had a near-goal in the 18th minute but Lindsay Preston made the leaping save to keep the game scoreless heading into the break. <BR><BR>
After the half, the offense picked up, with Georgetown recording five shots to Wake Forest's four. The Hoyas also held a 5-1 advantage in corner kicks in the second half, but the Deacon defense held strong and stopped all scoring opportunities to send the game into overtime. <BR><BR>
In the first overtime period, Feist nearly had the golden goal in the 96th minute but Georgetown's keeper made the diving save at the last second to keep the game knotted at zero. <BR><BR>
The Hoyas had a strong offensive performance in the second overtime period, but Preston managed to save one shot, one attempt hit the post and a third was deflected off a defender. Georgetown took a final attempt in the 108th minute, but it sailed high. <BR><BR>
By the end of the match, Georgetown held a 12-10 advantage in shots and an 8-3 edge in corner kicks. Wake Forest held a slight 5-4 advantage in shots on goal. <BR><BR>
Feist led the Deacs with four shots, three of which were on target, while Peyton Perea managed two shots, both on goal. Monreau DeVos, Kate Ravenna and Hannah Betfort also recorded shot attempts. <BR><BR>
The Demon Deacons will now face third-seeded Penn State at a site and date to be determined after the conclusion of second-seeded West Virginia/Bucknell and Rutgers/LaSalle matches.<BR><BR>
