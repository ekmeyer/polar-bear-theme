I’m Erin, a St. Louis native currently living in Kansas City, Missouri.<BR><BR>

I graduated from the University of Kansas in May 2016 with a degree in strategic communications, a journalism degree with a creative twist, and a minor in business.<BR><BR>

In October 2018, I traded the mountains and craft beers of North Carolina and moved to the Kansas City area to join Lockton Companies as a Marketing and Communications Coordinator. At Lockton, my role is primarily internal, supporting our account teams through various communications, including thought leadership, newsletters and social media.<BR><BR>
		
My previous stops include Wake Forest athletics as an Assistant Director of Athletic Communications, combining three of my favorite things: sports, social media and all things comms! I also interned for the for the World Champion Kansas City Royals in the Communications and Media Relations department from April – August 2016 and with the University of Kansas Athletics Communications Department my senior year of college.<BR><BR>

I’ve experienced so much more that can be found throughout this site!<BR><BR>

I’m fascinated by social media and pop culture, especially surrounding sports. When I’m not doing anything work related, I love to bake and one day hope to open a bakery. I enjoy drinking ridiculous amounts of coffee, playing with puppies and goofing off in InDesign.<BR><BR>

		So, let’s talk! I can be contacted by <a href="mailto:erinkmeyer@sbcglobal.net">email</a> or through my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erinkmeyer">LinkedIn</a> page. Resume, additional work samples and references are available upon request.<BR><BR>

Rock Chalk,<BR>

Erin
