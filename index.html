  <h1>Well, hello!</h1>

I’m Erin, a St. Louis native currently living in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.<BR><BR>

I graduated from the University of Kansas in May 2016 with a degree in strategic communications, a journalism degree with a creative twist, and a minor in business.<BR><BR>

In August 2016, I traded my toasted ravioli and Cardinals baseball for the mountains and craft beer when I accepted a job in the athletic communications at Wake Forest. My job perfectly combines three of my favorite things: sports, social media and all things comms!<BR><BR>

Expanding on my current position, I am an Assistant Director of Athletic Communications at Wake Forest after starting there as an intern. At Wake Forest, I update and manage content on wakeforestsports.com, create graphics for various teams, keep and maintain stats and records, produce game notes and serve as the liaison between student-athletes and the media. Since I began in August 2016, I have worked with the field hockey, volleyball, women’s soccer, men’s and women’s basketball, cross country and track & field programs.<BR><BR>

Previously, I interned for the for the World Champion Kansas City Royals in the Communications and Media Relations department from April – August 2016. I helped create postgame notes, minor league reports and stat packs while managing the press box on game days.<BR><BR>

My senior year, I interned in the University of Kansas Athletics Communications Department. My main focus was in sports information for the men’s basketball team. Through this position, I worked on many events including the Big 12 Men’s Basketball Tournament in Kansas City, Mo., the first and second rounds of the NCAA Women’s Volleyball Tournament, the NCAA  Track & Field West Preliminary Round and more.<BR><BR>

I’ve experienced so much more that can be found throughout this site!<BR><BR>

I’m fascinated by social media and pop culture, especially surrounding sports. When I’m not doing anything work related, I love to bake and one day hope to open a bakery. I enjoy drinking ridiculous amounts of coffee, playing with puppies and goofing off in InDesign.<BR><BR>

So, let’s talk! I can be contacted by email here or through my LinkedIn page. Resume, additional work samples and references are available upon request.<BR><BR>
