  <h1>Plans Book</h1>
In order to graduate with a degree in Strategic Communications at KU, you have to take a class called Campaigns. You're given a client and have to make a campaign from start to finish to help them achieve their goals. Here is our final plan book that I created in InDesign. Please feel free to click on the cover to see the full book.
