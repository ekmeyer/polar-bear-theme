<h1>Social Media</h1>
In my time at Wake Forest, I have gained a lot of experience managing campaigns and daily activity for Twitter and Instagram. Here you can see two case studies, <a href="#NCAA-Tennis">the 2018 NCAA Tennis Championships</a> and my 18 month tenure in charge of social for <a href="#Soccer">Women's Soccer</a>.

    <h2>Case Study: 2018 NCAA Tennis Championships</h2></a>
I was chosen for the position of Social Media Coordinator for the 2018 NCAA Men’s and Women’s Division I Tennis Championships. My role was to run the official @NCAATennis account however I saw fit. This account is dormant for approximately 50 weeks out of the year because the NCAA delegates it to a member of the tournament host school right before the Championships begin.<BR><BR>
The target audience was simply anyone interested in the NCAA Tennis Championships, whether they’re a casual college tennis fan or they had an interest in a team/participant. Since the account is only active for two weeks during the year, the objective was to inform and entertain fans during the tournament itself.<BR><BR>
My approach was to be informational while trying to add in some fun. During the two weeks, I posted a lot of text-only results with scores and bracket updates. We also posted inclement weather updates so that schools, participants and fans had up-to-date information. However, I added in photos of the venue/crowd, reaction videos of teams and individuals winning their matches, GIFs and results graphics for a total of 831 tweets. During the tournament, I also used hashtags that the teams use to expand the reach of these posts while keeping fans and the schools themselves engaged. My goal was to make fans feel as if they were sitting right there at the Wake Forest Tennis Complex, even if they couldn’t attend.<BR><BR>

       <h3>Results</h3>
        By the end of 14 days (12 days of the tournament plus a day before and a day after), the NCAA Twitter account saw great success analytically.<BR><BR>
The Twitter account gained 667 followers in the month of May, specifically 648 followers in the 14 days I had control of the account. This averages out to 46 new followers per day during the tournament.<BR><BR>
The 14 days of the NCAA Tournament saw 2.72 million impressions.  With over 6,000 followers, we averaged 190.6k impressions per day despite ranging from just four tweets per day to over 110 tweets. Our most successful day came the day after the NCAA Team Championships and the first day of the individual championships that saw over 70 schools represented (419,263 impressions on 91 tweets).<BR><BR>
During the tournament, our average engagement was a 2.6%, well above the sporting industry standard of 0.038 and the median across all industries of 0.046% (determined by RivalIQ).<BR><BR>

   <h4>Pinned Tweet</h4>
       This tweet was pinned to the top of our profile throughout the tournament. Because it was up for 13 total days, it was our highest engagement rate of the tournament. The post was simple and listed everything the fans need as well as a call to action (53,533 Impressions, 14,691 Engagements, 27.4% Engagement Rate). I also posted that same link at the beginning of each day as a reminder to fans. <BR><BR>

       <h4>NCAA Tennis Month</h4>
       Because the account is only active two weeks out of the year, the 28-day summary and changes were sky high. The account went from almost zero traction to a 3000% increase in profile visits during the month of May. Followers were using the account to connect to video streams and live stats, as well as keeping up to date on results and scores. The impressions also shot up 11000% due to a sharp increase in account activity and followers. <BR><BR>

<h2>Case Study: Wake Forest Women's Soccer - Postseason and Recruiting</h2></a>
One of the sports I have total social media control over is women’s soccer. Since I’ve taken over the accounts about a year ago, the Instagram has seen the highest increase in followers from 808 to 1,319 (63%). The Facebook has seen a 29% increase (696 to 899) in followers while Twitter has seen a 19% increase (3,063 to 3,650).
<BR><BR>
  <h3>WSOC Recruiting Campaign</h3>
    In 2017, the Wake Forest women’s soccer team returned to both the ACC and NCAA Tournament for the first time 2012 and 2013. After the season was over, I decided to capitalize on the great season we had to help appeal to potential recruits and transfers. I met with our women’s soccer multimedia coordinator and we decided to highlight the activities of some of our players that happens of the field.  The purpose was to show potential recruits and transfers that you’re more than a soccer player at Wake Forest.<BR><BR>
We created two videos highlighting two of our players who are heavily involved in an activity or organization outside of soccer. <BR><BR>
    <h3>The Results</h3>
    While most of the posts on our page are seen by parents (mainly women 45-54), it was mostly college aged women that viewed this video (18-24), the audience we were hoping to find. <BR><BR>
The two posts combined reached over 20,000 users and had over 8,000 views. The videos had over 2,500 post clicks and 700-plus reactions, comments and shares.<BR><BR>
The same two posts on Twitter earned nearly 20,000 impressions and almost 5,000 views. With the over 1,000 engagements, the engagement rate ended up being around 5.48%. <BR><BR>

    <h3> Women's Soccer Postseason</h3>
    Since women’s soccer made it’s first postseason appearance since 2013, I decided to have some fun with the content that was posted. From the day we were selected to the NCAA Tournament (Nov. 6) to the day we lost in the second round (Nov. 17), we earned 82 Twitter followers, 87 Instagram followers and 52 likes on Facebook while having some of our highest engagement rates of the season. <BR><BR>
